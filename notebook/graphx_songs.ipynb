    "# Lab 2 - Clustering with GraphX\n",
    "In this lab we use GraphX to cluster music songs according to the tags attached to each song. The datasets that we are working is available under the folder `data`, and also can be downloaded from [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shuochen/lme/data_page.html). The datasets consist of the following files:\n",
    "* `song_hash.txt`: this file maps a song ID to its title and artist.\n",
    "  + Each line corresponds to one song, and has the format called `Integer_ID\\tTitle\\tArtist\\n`.\n",
    "* `tag_hash.txt`: this one maps a tag ID to its name.\n",
    "  + Each line corresponds to one song, and has the format called `Integer_ID, Name\\n`.\n",
    "* `tags.txt`: this file includes the social tags by using the integer ID to represent songs.\n",
    "  + The tag data file has the same number of lines as the total number of songs. Each line consists of the IDs of the tags for a song, represented by integers, and separated by space. If a song does not have a tag, its line is just a #. Note that for the tag file, there is no space at the end of each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the data into a Spark graph property\n",
    "Let's start by loading the data into a Spark graph property. To do this, wee define a case class `Song`, with three attributes: `title`, `artist`, and a set of `tags`."
